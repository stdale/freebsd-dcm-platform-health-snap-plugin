# snap collector plugin - Intel OPEN DCM Platform Collector

 Plugin to collect inventory, health, power/thermal related metrics from platforms which expose such data through Intel Node Manager, DCMI or generic IPMI interfaces.
 Currently it is using Ipmitool or open ipmi driver to collect data. 
 This plugin is based on the snap-plugin-collector-node-manager and extend the coverage to more IPMI enabled platforms.

## Getting Started

 Plugin collects specified metrics in-band on OS level

### System Requirements

 - Support server platforms with Intel Node Manager, DCMI or generic IPMI support.
 - Currently it works only on Linux Servers (will be tested on a subset of Linux distributions)
 - Ipmitool needs to be installed on platform

### Installation
#### Download Intel OPEN DCM Platform plugin binary:
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture at snap's [Github Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/releases) page.

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-intel-dcm-platform
Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github/intelsdi-x/`:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-collector-intel-dcm-platform
```
Build the plugin by running make in repo:
```
$ make
```
This builds the plugin in `/build/rootfs`

### Configuration and Usage

 On OS level user needs to load modules:
  - ipmi_msghandler
  - ipmi_devintf
  - ipmi_si
 
Those modules provides specific IPMI device which can collect data from NM, DCMI or generic IPMI

There are currently 7 configuration options:
 - mode - defines mode of plugin work, possible values: legacy_inband, legacy_inband_openipmi, oob
 - channel - defines communication channel address (default: "0x00")
 - slave - defines target address (default: "0x00")
 - user - for OOB mode only, user for authentication to remote host
 - password - for OOB mode only, password for authentication to remote host
 - host - for OOB mode only, BMC IP address of host which will be monitored OOB
 - protocol - defines the communication protocol used to collect metric data, possible values: node_manager, dcmi, ipmi


Sample configuration of intel dcm platform plugin:
```
{
    "control" : {
	"plugins": {
            "collector": {
                "intel-dcm-platform": {
                    "all": {
                        "protocol": "node_manager",
			            "mode": "legacy_inband",
                        "channel": "0x06",
                        "slave": "0x2C"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Roadmap
As we launch this plugin, we have a few items in mind for the next release:
- Remove IPMI tool support
- More health info support
- Scalability support for multiple hosts
